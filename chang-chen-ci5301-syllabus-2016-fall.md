## College of Education & Human Development Mission Statement

The College of Education and Human Development is a world leader in discovering, creating, sharing, and applying principles and practices of multiculturalism and multidisciplinary scholarship to advance teaching and learning and to enhance the psychological, physical, and social development of children, youth, and adults across the lifespan in families, organizations, and communities.


## Course Description & Themes

*Digital literacies* is defined as "the capabilities which fit someone for living, learning and working in a digital society" ([Jisc, 2014](https://www.jisc.ac.uk/full-guide/developing-digital-literacies)). It looks beyond functional information & communication technologies (ICT) skills to describe a richer set of digital *behaviors*, *practices* and *identities*. This course aims to help students develop vital digital literacies in the professions of business, marketing, education, etc. The course will be guided by the following themes.

### Computer Literacy and Business Software

- How could educators and business professionals harness the power of information technologies to effectively communicate ideas?
- How should educators prepare students for the necessary computer literacy skills (e.g., word processing, presentation, data analysis software, web browsing, etc.) needed in their personal and professional lives?
- How should the fields of education and business react to the ever changing landscape of ICT?

### Computer Supported Collaborative Work

- How are communication tools like email, instant messaging, and web conferencing software applied in business and education?
- How is mobile computing shaping the way businesses function?
- What opportunities and challenges to businesses and educators have using web conferencing tools (e.g., Google Hangouts, Adobe Connect, WebEx, Skype)?
- In what ways are virtual collaboration tools (e.g., Google Docs, wikis, knowledge bases) influencing business operations?

### Authoring on the Web

- What are the basic web languages (i.e., HTML, CSS, Javascript)?
- How to design and develop a creative and practical website using state-of-the-art content management systems?
- How to harness web technologies to construct and maintain one's online presence/identity?
- How to sustain engagement of an online community (of learners, fans, or consumers)?
- What ethical and cybersecurity issues should be considered when authoring on the Web?

## Course Website

This course uses a Canvas website, and is currently separate from the MyU system. It can be found at https://umn.instructure.com/courses/750. If you are having trouble finding the site, please email the instructors.

## Course Structure

This is an online course with all course activities being completed online through [the course website](https://umn.instructure.com/courses/750). Please review all course information and activities on Canvas. Our class is entirely asynchronous, so you are responsible for your own time management and moving through the readings, activities, and assignments at the appropriate and recommended pace.  *Note*: You will have one synchronous meeting online with your *Base Group*. You will need to arrange this meeting time with your group three weeks prior to your meeting time, so that you have plenty of time to find a common time and secure it on your calendar.

### Class Modules

This class is designed with 14 modules. We will cover one module in each week, with the "class meeting day" and deadlines on Mondays (more details below). I recommend that you log in to the course site *at least* once every day. This will ensure you see any important announcements, and are able to keep up with discussions as needed.

### Textbook & Readings

There is no textbook you must purchase for this course. All of the readings will be accessible through the course website.

### Required Technology Tools

Please see a complete listing of all technology requirements posted online. Our course uses a variety of computer technology tools throughout the course. Make sure you have access to the following:

- Computer that meets the minimum hardware requirements for course software
- High Speed Internet Access
- Microphone / Headset
- Microsoft Office Suite 2010 (or newer) or other word processing, spreadsheet, and presentation software
- All related multimedia plug-ins and add-ons for web browser

### Internet Access

This course will make use of the Internet for both e-mail communication and access to documents on the World Wide Web. All registered University of Minnesota students are currently provided an email address and free access to the Internet. The following assumptions are made about your access and use of the Internet:

- Students are assumed to have access to a computer either personally or through the [University's Computer Labs](https://it.umn.edu/computer-labs-locations-and-hours), to have activated their email and Internet count, and to have basic computer skills. (In other words, “My computer (or Internet) wasn’t working” is not an acceptable excuse for missed assignments or deadlines.)
- Assistance in using email and the Internet is available through the University of Minnesota [Tech Stop](http://www.oit.umn.edu/techstop/). Students who need extra assistance in using Internet software in order to complete the course requirements should talk with the instructor.

For email communications with the instructors, expect a response within 24--48 hours. Plan ahead of time if you have questions.


## Assignments and Grades

(All assignments are subject to change)

Please review the complete listing of assignments and description of activities. Details will be available on Canvas.

**Online Group Discussions**

Each Discussion Forum grade is worth 3 points: 1 point for your own post in answering the question and 1 point for each response you post. In other words, in addition to your own post, which answers the original question, you must also respond to two other posts with a substantial response (around 3-4 sentences).

- Whole-class FlipGrid Intro: 4 point
- Base Group discussion on web design initial ideas: 3 points
- Critique of website example:  3 points
- Base group Discussion on Digital Literacy:  3 points
- Base group critique of survey design: 3 points
- Discussion for Virtual Collaboration:  3 points
- Discussion for Social Networking: 3 points
- Whole-class Independent Professional Development Forum: 3 points

**Checkpoint Activities**

The checkpoint activities are designed to keep you on task for some of our larger projects and provide you with an opportunity to solicit feedback and suggestions from your classmates. Each checkpoint activity will describe what you are expected to accomplish. In general you will be asked to share a project or portion of your project, share details of your project, answer the questions provided in the activity, and then provide feedback to your classmates or group members.

- Checkpoint Activity for Virtual Collaboration:  5 points
- Checkpoint Activity for Web Authoring:  5 points
- Screencast Analysis: 5 points

**Personal Reflections**

You will be asked to write personal reflections on the various topics we will cover in this course. The reflections will range from approximately 2–4 paragraphs each. You will be asked to think critically and respond to questions about the topics covered in class.

- Reflection on Digital Literacy:  10 points
- Reflection on Virtual Collaboration:  10 points
- Reflection on Web Authoring:  10 points

**Case Based Projects**

There will be four case based projects during this course. In each case you will be putting theory into practice by creating important business-related elements. Each project will describe what you are expected to accomplish. The document portfolio, website, and screencast projects will be completed individually and the webinar will be a group project.

- Website: 20 points
- Document Portfolio: 20 points
- Webinar (Group Project): 20 points
- Screencast Project: 20 points

**TOTAL Points Possible:  150**

### Course Policy on Deadlines & Late Assignments

Whether we like them or not, deadlines are an important, ubiquitous part of our lives--personally, academically, and to meet the professional demands of employers and colleagues. I have set deadlines for all assignments and they are clearly communicated throughout the syllabus and will be on Canvas. However, I recognize that as adult learners, we all have competing life demands that can present scheduling and time management challenges. I would like to try to help personalize this course experience for you as much as I reasonably can, so the following is my course policy on deadlines and late assignments:

As the facilitator of a group of adult learners, I recognize that life happens. If you find that a specific deadline does not work for you or you need more time for an assignment, IF YOU CONTACT ME IN ADVANCE PRIOR TO THE INITIAL DEADLINE, you can establish your own new deadline. To change an assignment deadline, you must email me and propose a reasonable alternate deadline (DATE & TIME) that would not disrupt your peers' work; I will then make note of it in my records and you will be held to it. However, **if I receive no PRIOR communication from you (before the original deadline arrives) and you submit an assignment late, the assignment will be penalized at the rate of 10% per day** that it is submitted past the due date/time. This is significant for all assignments. Since we'll be moving fast in this class, discussion contributions that are more than two days late will result in zero points for that class session.

## Class Schedule (tentative)

Class Schedule is subject to change.  Please use the Canvas site for any changes and the most up-to-date schedule.

**Definition of Grades**

- A - achievement that is outstanding relative to the level necessary to meet course requirements.
- B - achievement that is significantly above the level necessary to meet course requirements.
- C - achievement that meets the course requirements in every respect.
- D - achievement that is worthy of credit even though it fails to meet fully the course requirements.
- S - achievement that is satisfactory, which is equivalent to a C- or better (achievement required for an S is at the discretion of the instructor but may be no lower than equivalent to a C-.)
- F (or N) - Represents failure (or no credit) and signifies that the work was either (1) completed but at a level of achievement that is not worthy of credit or (2) was not completed and there was no agreement between the instructor and the student that the student would be awarded an I (see also I).

The grading for this course is as follows:

<table><tr><td>A</td><td>94 – 100%</td><td>C+</td><td>77 – 79%</td><td>D+</td><td>67 – 69%</td><td>F</td><td>Below 60%</td></tr><tr><td>A-</td><td>90 – 93%</td><td>C</td><td>74 – 76%</td><td>D</td><td>64 – 66%</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>B+</td><td>87 – 89%</td><td>C-</td><td>70 – 73%</td><td>D-</td><td>60 – 63%</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>B</td><td>84 – 86%</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>B-</td><td>80 – 83%</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>

It is worth noting here that the structure of this course is more about your learning than it is about a grade.  You are each capable of “A” work, and it is my assumption everyone starts with an “A”.  It is ultimately up to you to prove me wrong.  

You will be provided feedback to help guide you to more resources, areas where you can improve, and aspects you are doing well in.  This feedback will typically be in the form of text- or audio-formats.  I will only communicate what your grade is upon request.  

**Academic Dishonesty**

Academic dishonesty in any portion of the academic work for a course shall be grounds for awarding a grade of F or N for the entire course.

**Incomplete Grades:**

The grade of "I" is not a regular University grade and cannot be given without **special arrangements under unusual circumstances**.  It cannot be given merely to extend the time allowed to complete course requirements.  If family or personal emergency requires that your attention be diverted from the course and that more time than usual is needed to complete course work, arrangements should be made with the instructor of the course before the quarter ends and consent obtained for receiving an "Incomplete" or "I" grade.  These arrangements should be made as soon as the need for an "I" can be anticipated.  A written agreement should be prepared indicating when the course assignment will be completed.  Normally an "Incomplete" grade for a course should be removed within one quarter of its receipt.

**Receipt of Final Grade:**

University policies do not permit the posting of final course grades nor the reporting of these grades over the telephone.  If you would like a record of your course grade before it is available via the University web site, provide a self-addressed stamped envelope to the instructor at some point prior to the last class session.

**Feedback on projects:**

During the course, feedback will be returned to students as soon as possible via our course website or email.  I reserve the right to return your project with an expectation of your re-doing it to better reflect your best work.  

### Disabilities

The University of Minnesota is committed to providing equitable access to learning opportunities for all students.  The Disability Resource Center (DRC) is the campus office that collaborates with students who have disabilities to provide and/or arrange reasonable accommodations.

- If you have, or think you may have, a disability (e.g., mental health, attentional, learning, chronic health, sensory, or physical), please contact the DRC at 612-626-1333 to arrange a confidential discussion regarding equitable access and reasonable accommodations.
- If you are registered with the DRC and have a current letter requesting reasonable accommodations, we encourage you to contact your instructor early in the semester to review how the accommodations will be applied in the course.

Additional information is available on the DRC website: https://diversity.umn.edu/disability/

### Mental Health

As a student you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance or reduce your ability to participate in daily activities. University of Minnesota services are available to assist you with addressing these and other concerns you may be experiencing.  You can learn more about the broad range of confidential mental health services available on campus via http://www.mentalhealth.umn.edu

### Sexual Harassment

[Sexual harassment](http://www1.umn.edu/regents/policies/humanresources/SexHarassment.pdf) means unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and/or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when: (1) submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment or academic advancement in any University activity or program; (2) submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis of employment or academic decisions affecting this individual in any University activity or program; or (3) such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work or academic performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working or academic environment in any University activity or program.
